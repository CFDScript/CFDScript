# Contributing to FEAScript

Thank you for your interest in contributing! FEAScript is in early development, with continuous additions of new features and improvements. To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please review and follow the guidelines below.

## Development Environment & Coding Style

- Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for automatic code formatting
- Use a **110-character line width** to maintain consistent formatting
- Observe the code near your intended changes and aim to preserve that style in your modifications

## Variable & File Naming

- Use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) formatting for variable names throughout the code
- JavaScript source file names use camelCase (e.g., `logging.js`, `meshGeneration.js`, `newtonRaphson.js`)

### Exceptions

- Public entry file: `index.js` (standard entry point convention)
- Core model file: `FEAScript.js` (matches the library name)

## File Structure

All files in the FEAScript-core codebase should follow this structure:

1.  Banner: All files start with the FEAScript banner
2.  Imports:
    - External imports first, alphabetically ordered
    - Internal imports next, grouped by module/folder
3.  Classes/Functions: Implementation with proper JSDoc comments

Example:

```javascript
/**
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  FEAScript Library
 *  Lightweight Finite Element Simulation in JavaScript
 *  Version: {VERSION} | https://feascript.com
 *  MIT License © 2023–20xx FEAScript
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 */

// External imports
import { mathLibrary } from "math-package";

// Internal imports
import { relatedFunction } from "../utilities/helper.js";

/**
 * Class to handle specific functionality
 */
export class MyClass {
  /**
   * Constructor to initialize the class
   * @param {object} options - Configuration options
   */
  constructor(options) {
    // Implementation
  }

  /**
   * Function to perform a specific action
   * @param {number} input - Input value
   * @returns {number} Processed result
   */
  doSomething(input) {
    // Implementation
    return input * DEFAULT_VALUE;
  }
}
```

## Branching & Workflow

To contribute a new feature or fix:

- Do not commit directly to `main`
- Instead, create a short‑lived branch:
  - `feature/<topic>` for new functionality
  - `fix/<issue>` for bug fixes

External contributors:

1.  Fork the repo
2.  Branch from `main` in your fork
3.  Push and open a PR from your fork’s branch into `main`

## Local Testing

Before submitting a pull request, test your modifications by running the FEAScript library from a local directory. For example, you can load the library in your HTML file as follows:

```javascript
import { FEAScriptModel, plotSolution, printVersion } from "[USER_DIRECTORY]/FEAScript-core/src/index.js";
```

FEAScript can be run on a local server. You **must** start the server from the workspace root directory (the folder that contains both `FEAScript-core/` and `FEAScript-website/`), not from inside either subfolder. The HTML files use relative paths such as `../feascript-website.css` and `../../FEAScript-core/src/index.js` that only resolve correctly from that root.

```bash
# Navigate to the workspace root first
cd /path/to/FEAScript-workspace

# Then start the server
python3 -m http.server
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Open a tutorial at its full path, e.g.:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/FEAScript-website/tutorials/solidification-front-2d-worker.html
```

Static file server npm packages like [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve#readme) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/) can also be used.

Testing can be also performed at the Node.js environment. In this case you can also run predefined tests to make sure nothing is broken. This performed as follows:

```bash
npm test
```

This command uses the Node.js test runner to discover all test files under `tests/`. The tests compare numerical results against stored reference solutions and verify individual solver and assembler behavior.
