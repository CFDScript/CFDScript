## Contributing to CFDScript

Thank you for your interest in contributing!</br>
CFDScript is in early development with continuous addition of new features and improvements. To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please review and follow the guidelines.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Search the <a href="https://github.com/CFDScript/CFDScript/wiki/Roadmap" target="_blank">project roadmap</a> to see areas where help is needed.

2. Respect the existing CFDScript coding style. Observe the code near your intended change and attempt to preserve that style with your modifications.

3. We recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode" target="_blank">Prettier</a> plugin for automatic code formatting. 

4. Ensure that you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" target="_blank">camelCase</a> formatting for variable names throughout the code.

5. Before committing, you can test your modifications by running the CFDscript library from a local server. To do this, use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html" target="_blank">Python HTTP Server</a> by executing the following <a href="https://github.com/CFDScript/CFDScript-website/blob/main/corsHttpServer.py" target="_blank">script</a>. Start the Python server by running `python3 corsHttpServer.py` in your local repository folder. The server address will be http://0.0.0.0:8000/. For more details, see the instructions under the 'Import the CFDscript library from a local server' section in the <a href="https://github.com/CFDScript/CFDScript-website/blob/main/exampleHeatTrasnfer.html" target="_blank">2D heat transfer example</a>.
